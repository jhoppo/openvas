Installation Step:

Image: mikesplain/openvas

Steps:
  1. Create pod first
  2. Copy /var/lib/openvas from pod into pv folder
  3. Close pod created at step 1
  4. Create new pod with pvc with same image, mount pvc on pod's /var/lib/openvas folder

WHY to create pod twice?
  Since no official document says where the data is stored at.
  It means, the data is not permanently stored in host.
  Therfore, I figured out this way to make it be stored permanently in host.
  Now the data will not disappear everytime re-build the pod.


How to practice in this case:
  kubectl create -f pre-deploy.yaml
  kubectl cp openvas<<PRESS TAB TO FILL UP THE POD NAME>>:/var/lib/openvas ./data
  kubectl delete -f pre-deploy.yaml
  kubectl create -f 000-vol.yaml -f 001-deploy.yaml -f 002-service.yaml

NOTICE:
  - The directory data must be 777 masked.
